# Diegetic Gaze Control

Diegetic Gaze Control is an innovative system designed to enable intuitive interaction with printed paper interfaces, physical environments, and robots using only your eye-gaze. This project aims to empower individuals, particularly those with disabilities, by providing a natural and seamless way to control assistive devices without the constraints of traditional screens or complex hardware.

At the core of Diegetic Gaze Control is the use of gaze-tracking glasses such as Pupil Neon Glasses or Tobii Glasses Pro 2. These glasses capture the userâ€™s eye movements and translate them into control signals for interacting with printed interfaces or everyday objects. The system utilizes ArUco markers for precise detection and interaction, ensuring that users can effortlessly engage with their surroundings.

This project leverages several powerful technologies, including ROS2 for robotic control, Docker for easy deployment. By integrating these tools, Diegetic Gaze Control provides a robust and flexible platform for research and practical applications in assistive technology.
