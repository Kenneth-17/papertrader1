## Introduction

Diegetic Gaze Control is an innovative system designed to enable intuitive interaction with printed paper interfaces, physical environments, and robots using only your eye-gaze. This project aims to empower individuals, particularly those with disabilities, by providing a natural and seamless way to control assistive devices without the constraints of traditional screens or complex hardware.

At the core of Diegetic Gaze Control is the use of gaze-tracking glasses such as Pupil Neon Glasses or Tobii Glasses Pro 2. These glasses capture the user’s eye movements and translate them into control signals for interacting with printed interfaces or everyday objects. The system utilizes ArUco markers for precise detection and interaction, ensuring that users can effortlessly engage with their surroundings.

This project leverages several powerful technologies, including ROS2 for robotic control, Docker for easy deployment, and OpenCV for image processing. By integrating these tools, Diegetic Gaze Control provides a robust and flexible platform for research and practical applications in assistive technology.

### Key Features

- **Intuitive Interaction**: Control interfaces and objects with eye-gaze, maintaining a natural and comfortable user experience.
- **Versatile Hardware**: Compatible with Pupil Neon Glasses, Tobii Glasses Pro 2, or a standard USB webcam.
- **Flexible Interfaces**: Use printed paper interfaces that are easy to create, customize, and replace.
- **Safe and Practical**: Keeps the user’s gaze on the task, enhancing safety and ease of use without causing VR sickness.
- **Robust Technology Stack**: Built on ROS2, Docker, and OpenCV for reliability and ease of deployment.

Diegetic Gaze Control is ideal for researchers, developers, and practitioners in the fields of assistive technology, human-computer interaction, and robotics. It provides a foundation for developing new applications that leverage eye-gaze for control and interaction, opening up new possibilities for empowering users and enhancing accessibility.
